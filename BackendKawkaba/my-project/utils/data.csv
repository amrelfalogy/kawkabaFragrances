Quentin has devised a detonating duo: magnetic ylang-ylang on an intriguing popcorn-note explosion. The notes vibrate against each other, together in tension. To trigger, in an avalanche of the senses, a moment of explosive erotica.""  The formula explosion: ylang-ylang, vanilla, popcorn note, sandalwood, ambrette seeds. The photo campaign is realized by the famous photographer Nathaniel Goldberg, who is also behind the Million and Pure XS campaigns.

Hacivat was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Jorge Lee. Top notes are Pineapple, Grapefruit and Bergamot; middle notes are Cedar, Patchouli and Jasmine; base notes are Oakmoss and Woody Notes. “For the collection named as “SHADOW PLAY” launched in 2017, NISHANE has got the main inspiration from the traditional shadow play which is also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.
KARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from ""Hacı İvaz"" meaning ""İvaz the Pilgrim""), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece.
The creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.
HACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.
ZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.
KARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity” — press release of the brand.

Gucci Bloom was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top note is Jasmine; middle note is Tuberose; base note is Rangoon creeper. Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: “I wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,” Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director’s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele’s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.
Gucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom’s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.
 
ABOUT THE SCENT:  Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.
 
Authenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.
Notes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent’s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine’s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:  An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance’s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.
 
“The bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,” he said.
 
A vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliquéd with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.
  ABOUT CAMPAIGN:  Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign’s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci’s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign’s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds.     
 
Dancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci’s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom.

Acqua di Gioia was launched in 2010. Acqua di Gioia was created by Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion. Top notes are Amalfi Lemon and Mint; middle notes are Jasmine, Peony and Pink Pepper; base notes are Virginia Cedar, French labdanum and Brown sugar. Acqua di Gioia is a new fragrance by Giorgio Armani, presented in March 2010. Seductive sea aromas in the new fragrance are put into first plan and used as creators' inspiration. Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''.
Inspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.
Its flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.
The fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.
The perfume can be purchased as 30, 50 and 100 ml EDP, along with 200 ml body lotion.

Lady Million was launched in 2010. Lady Million was created by Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Dominique Ropion and Bruno Jovanovic. Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange flower and Gardenia; base notes are white honey, Patchouli and Amber. 1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.
Flacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.

The Notes of Fragrance
Anne Flipo, Béatrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? “It was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This ‘playful’ aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Amber spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets”.
 Designer of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp.
We can expect the fragrance on the market in July 2010. Lady Million makes men's fantasy and desires come true. Advertising face is Dree Hemingway.
