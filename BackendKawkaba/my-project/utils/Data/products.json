Top notes are Bergamot, Pink Pepper and elemi; middle notes are Cashmere Wood, Atlas Cedar and Patchouli; base notes are Iso E Super, Haitian Vetiver and White Musk. Dior Homme, a powdery iris and woody scent for men, was introduced in the original version in 2005 and then later came the new 2011 version. The 2020 version of Dior Homme Eau de Toilette is announced with the slogan \"I'm Your Man.\" The 2011 edition remains on the shelves under the name, Dior Homme Original. The new Dior Homme is created by Dior in-house perfumer Francois Demachy who wanted to redefine masculine sensuality. The fragrance is intensely woody, warm, and sensual. A virile accord of Atlas cedar and the warmth of cashmere wood are pampered with spicy aromas.  \"This new Dior Homme has an unmistakably virile signature that does not prevent it from developing tender, sensual accents. It basically draws the portrait of a modern man.\" François Demachy, Dior Perfumer-Creator According to the perfumer, this is a fragrance overdosed with carnal woody notes, and it represents a return to the basics: classic and simplicity. It is clear, clean, gentle, and woody but also slightly sweet, and wears like a second skin. The new bottle follows the architectural design of its predecessors, with a more prominent logo and perfume name on the plug. The face of the advertising campaign remains actor Robert Pattinson. Dior Homme is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with the accompanying grooming line, now available in new packaging.

While The Only One Eau de Parfum celebrated a head-turning glamour that draws admiration from all, and The Only One 2 Eau de Parfum captured the power of desire, The Only One Eau de Parfum Intense now celebrates the most enchanting and fascinating qualities of The Only One woman. The absolute essence of mesmerizing allure and irresistible sensuality, this hypnotic fragrance is bewitching, beguiling and utterly addictive. The Only One Eau de Parfum Intense builds on the floriental legacy of The Only One line with a captivating new scent. Like the woman it represents, the fragrance is an intricate combination of intense and solar sensuality. Alluringly feminine and irresistibly seductive, its signature lies in the surprising combination of dazzling gold\norange blossom contrasted with hypnotizing black vanilla. Top notes of sparkling Italian mandarin, crisp green apple accord and golden neroli essence illuminate the radiant floral heart of the fragrance. Notes of dazzling gold orange blossom mingle with the heady sensuality of jasmine absolute, and are softly enveloped by creamy, lush coconut essence, which lends a warm and sunny aura to the scent. Smooth, sweet notes of dark vanilla in the base amplify its addictive quality, underpinned by grounding cedar and cashmere woods. Maintaining the graphic architectural form of The Only One, the bottle is now reinvented in black, the iconic colour of Dolce&Gabbana, which reflects the hypnotic intensity of the fragrance within. The gold ring detail evokes the radiant elegance of The Only One woman, while the sinuous cursive script conjures her seductive silhouette. For the video campaign, Italian director Matteo Garrone renewed his collaboration with actress Emilia Clarke. Set in a traditional trattoria in Rome, the film opens with Emilia surrounded by her friends. Encouraged by them, Emilia starts to sing the classic Italian song “Quando, Quando, Quando”, alongside a group of local musicians. Cheered on by the crowd, her natural aura and intense femininity draws the fascination of all around her. For the print campaign, the Morelli Brothers captured the vibrant energy of the scene, showcasing the spontaneous spirit so characteristic of their work.\" The Only One Eau de Parfum Intense is available as a 30ml Eau de Parfum Intense, 50ml Eau de Parfum Intense and 100ml Eau de Parfum Intense from January 2020.

A storm in just a tuxedo jacket, and her bare legs.Like an endless compass that one would follow to the end of the world. So sexy.As she strolled by, I saw them all stop mid-sentence. A shock in slow motion. So scandal-ized!\nFaintly amused by the silent turbulence she sowed in her wake, she heads straight to her table, the one with her gang. Unapologetically determinedthat the show goes on, her attitude had no latitude for discretion or reserve. This woman lives on in my memory, to the point of obsession: her perfume, SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier. The very essence of a scandal.\nOrange blossom, so bright, Sambac jasmine so opulent and tuberose so powdery: a threesome of white flowers that one could have sworn would deliver an angelic sweetness.\nAnd boom! It’s a bomb of all that is sensual!\nJuicy raspberry, a gourmetmilkiness with sexy undertones presses all the carnal buttons. A simple aphrodisiac, a deadly weapon that’s deeply erotic. Daphne Bugey and Fabrice Pellegrin. It’s not their first tango.\nShe says \"freedom is to be unafraid\".\nHe has his own motto engraved on the back of his watch, \"carpe diem\", as if to better savour the scandal he created with his partner in crime. Languidly pleasing pleats, round hips and a tiny waist,legs akimbo the up side is down. A handmade scandal. A pink sap courses through this objet, like the life juice of a dangerously irresistible fruit. The design, the drapery, this bottle sets the scene for a story that is meant to be written all through the night and maybe even into day break. Trouble and troubling sensations guaranteed. The color of a grand cru, intensely raspberry, almost bordeaux.\nVelvety shades. For a colour that colours the night with couture, sound in two parts: SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier. It’s perfectly clear, and it sounds like a champagne cork explosion.\" So Scandal! is available as a 30, 50 and 80ml Eau de Parfum.

Pure XS For Her was created by Quentin Bisch and Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann. After the success of last year's edition Paco Rabanne Pure XS for Him, advertised by Francisco Henriques, the woman's version is announced, described as wild and very provocative. Paco Rabanne makes a new step in the XS line by launching PURE XS FOR HER EAU DE PARFUM: an erotic floral-oriental edition advertised by the new brand ambassador, American actress and model Emily Ratajkowski. The perfumer who composed and signed the newest Rabanne release is Quentin Bisch. \"A wildly provocative – and wildly untamed – floral created by Quentin Bisch, an impassioned and passionate perfumer at Givaudan. Inspired by one of his trips to Reunion Island, he came back to Paris obsessed with a heady, dazzling ylang-ylang. His goal: to bottle the essence of an orgasm, an explosion of the senses brought within reach with a distinctive Paco flair. Quentin has devised a detonating duo: magnetic ylang-ylang on an intriguing popcorn-note explosion. The notes vibrate against each other, together in tension. To trigger, in an avalanche of the senses, a moment of explosive erotica.\"  The formula explosion: ylang-ylang, vanilla, popcorn note, sandalwood, ambrette seeds. The photo campaign is realized by the famous photographer Nathaniel Goldberg, who is also behind the Million and Pure XS campaigns. The face and muse for the newest Paco Rabanne creation is Emily Ratajkowski. The sculptural bottle resembles the shape of the Black XS Eau de Parfum from 2018 with sharper edges then the previous Black XS editions, made in an ombre-style of powder pink shades, while the pink outer box is made with a velvety finish and gold-colored details. The fragrance Pure XS For Her is available as a 30ml Eau de Parfum, 50ml Eau de Parfum and 80ml Eau de Parfum.

Versace Eros Flame, is a flanker to the original masculine Eros from 2012. While the pillar is an aromatic-fougère, the new scent goes into a totally different direction with citrusy, spicy, woody, and ambery accords, described as \"cold and hot, sweet and spicy, light and shadow.\" The concept is based on an interpretation of passionate love, marketed as a fragrance for a \"strong, passionate, self-confident man who is deeply in touch with his emotions.\" Olivier Pescheux developed the composition as one of contrasts; the head notes are made to be vivacious and fresh with italian citruses, black pepper and rosemary. Pepperwood, geranium and rose facets are in the heart, before a warm base of woods, blended with tonka and vanilla. The advertising campaign is a modern interpretation of Canova's iconic \"Eros and Psyche\" sculpture, where a man embraces a woman played by Gigi Hadid and Salomon Diaz. The campaign is shot by Steven Meisel. Versace Eros Flame is available as a 30, 50, 100 and 200 ml Eau de Parfum, a 100 ml After Shave Lotion, a 100 ml After Shave Balm, a 75 ml Deodorant Stick, a 100 ml Deodorant and a 250 ml Shower Gel.  Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.",

    "description": "Hacivat by Nishane is a Chypre fragrance for women and men. Hacivat was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Jorge Lee. Top notes are Pineapple, Grapefruit and Bergamot; middle notes are Cedar, Patchouli and Jasmine; base notes are Oakmoss and Woody Notes. “For the collection named as “SHADOW PLAY” launched in 2017, NISHANE has got the main inspiration from the traditional shadow play which is also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\nKARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hacı İvaz\" meaning \"İvaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece.\nThe creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity” — press release of the brand.

Top notes are Blood Orange and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Honey, Gardenia, Orange Blossom, Jasmine and Peach; base notes are Beeswax, Patchouli, Caramel and Licorice. New pillar fragrance from Jean Paul Gaultier is launched in June 2017 in collaboration with PUIG and named SCANDAL. Scandal is designed to break all clichés, offering something new and modern, and at the same time powerful and elegant. The key notes of the composition are blood orange, honey, patchouli and gardenia, which united share a creamy, earthy and balsamic gourmet effect, with warm, deep, woody undertones. The bottle of the new fragrance SCANDAL is made of transparent glass while the stopper is designed in the sculptural form of female legs in a golden color. This is the first fragrance of Jean Paul Gaultier launched with Puig company. The brand stated that they wanted to offer a different version of previous fragrances from the Jean Paul Gaultier collection respecting the well-known DNA of the brand and \"to stop the fever of limited editions.\" The goal is to create something more spicy, festive, sexy and fun, from the bottle to the campaign. The advertising campaign was created as a mix of sex and politics. “We decided to tell the life of ‘Madame La Ministre.’ She’s a government minister who goes partying at night in Paris’ Pigalle neighborhood and makes her way directly into the office for her day job. The advertising face is model Vanessa Axente, leaving a club in a form-fitting black number. In her waiting car, filled with friends, she’s literally cut out of the outfit as her car speeds through the streets of Paris toward the Élysée Palace, where she steps out elegantly in a tailored outfit to join colleagues,\" explains Jose Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig. Scandal is available in 30 ml Eau de Parfum; 50ml Eau de Parfum and 80 ml Eau de Parfum. In addition to the Eau de Parfum, the collection also includes perfumed body care products: a Shower Gel of 200ml and a Body Lotion of 200ml.

    "description": "Gucci Bloom by Gucci is a Floral fragrance for women. Gucci Bloom was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top note is Jasmine; middle note is Tuberose; base note is Rangoon creeper. Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: “I wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,” Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director’s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele’s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.\nGucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom’s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.\n \nABOUT THE SCENT:  Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.\n \nAuthenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.\nNotes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent’s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine’s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:  An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance’s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.\n \n“The bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,” he said.\n \nA vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliquéd with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.\n  ABOUT CAMPAIGN:  Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign’s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci’s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign’s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds.     \n \nDancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci’s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom.\n  The fragrance will be available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.

    "description": "Sì Passione by Giorgio Armani is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Sì Passione was launched in 2017. Sì Passione was created by Christine Nagel and Julie Masse. Top notes are Pear, Black Currant, Pink Pepper and Grapefruit; middle notes are Rose, Pineapple, Heliotrope and Jasmine; base notes are Vanilla, Cedar, Patchouli and Amberwood. In December 2017, Armani launches a new edition of Sì fragrance from 2013, represented by Hollywood actress Cate Blanchett. Sì Passione is a reinterpretation of the original that gives it a new dimension - described as \"an irresistible combination of grace, strength and independent spirit.\" Announced as an intense, uncompromising scent, it is made for a confident woman who dares to say yes, and is to embody the red lipstick effect in the bottle. \"Sì Passione is a bright and sensual perfume that emits confidence, seduction, and strength. Bright and fresh in its initial impression, Sì Passione opens with notes of spicy pink pepper, like a burst of adrenaline. After initially drawing attention, sparkling and radiant pear brightens the iconic juicy blackcurrant to add boldness. A floral heart beats passionately with rose and feminine jasmine to create a powerful scent, like a seemingly fragile woman who shows incredible strength when guided by passion. The addition of heliotrope makes this perfume addictive and acts as an invitation to self-indulgence and pleasure. The warm and sensual vanilla and cedarwood dry down mirrors the self-assurance that a swipe of red lipstick can instantly give the wearer.\" The fragrance is available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.

Top notes are Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose and Orange Blossom; middle note is Musk; base notes are Coumarin, Cedar, Vetiver and Patchouli. With Narciso Eau de Parfum (2014), Narciso Rodriguez continued with its musky scented creations in minimalistic bottles that began with the debut fragrance Narciso Rodriguez For Her (2003). In June, 2015, Narciso Eau de Toilette was presented in a square, black bottle. The collection's new fragrance for early 2016 is housed in a bottle of delicate skin color that befits the name Narciso Poudrée. This story of sensuality and seduction continues with a new chapter - velvety, powerful and delicate at the same time; warm and strong Narciso Poudrée. The goal was to create a fragrant cloud that highlights a natural and mature femininity. Powdery musk dominates the heart of the perfume, which opens with a floral combination of Bulgarian rose and white jasmine. Woody notes of vetiver, black and white cedar end the composition. The face of the perfume is Raquel Zimmermann. Narciso Poudrée is available as 30, 50 and 90 ml Eau de Parfum.

Top notes are Grapefruit, Coriander and Basil; middle notes are Ginger, Cardamom and Orange Blossom; base notes are Amber, Tobacco and Cedar. After presenting more than successful fragrance for women, The One, Dolce&Gabbana house launched a fragrance for men named The One for Men at the begining of March 2008. Creating this fragrance, Stefano Gabbana was following the idea of creating an uomo, a very masculine fragrance, and a very classic one, \\\"not a banal classic, but a classic men\\'s fragrance that would last for years and be the type of scent that women adore\\\". The notes of this fragrance are composed in accordance with the Gabbana creator\\'s taste, who wanted to create a woody-oriental composition. In line with that Gabbana said:\"I like spicy-oriental notes and we\\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents\". Fragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco. The fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top. The model of the fragrance advertising campaign will be the actor Matthew McConaughey, who will next week join the designers in the NYC. When it comes to the choice of the model, the Dolce&Gabbana designers said that they wanted to have the sexiest man on the planet. And with regards to that, Gabbana adds that this is the first time that a model in one of D&G men\\'s fragrance campaigns appears in clothes. The One for Men will be available in the US as EDT in two sizes – 50ml and 100ml bottles. Besides EDT the collection will include 100ml aftershave lotion, 75ml aftershave balm, 200ml shower gel and 75ml deodorant stick.

Top notes are Amalfi Lemon and Mint; middle notes are Jasmine, Peony and Pink Pepper; base notes are Virginia Cedar, French labdanum and Brown sugar. Acqua di Gioia is a new fragrance by Giorgio Armani, presented in March 2010. Seductive sea aromas in the new fragrance are put into first plan and used as creators' inspiration. Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''.\nInspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.\nIts flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.\nThe fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.\nThe perfume can be purchased as 30, 50 and 100 ml EDP, along with 200 ml body lotion.

    "description": "Lady Million by Paco Rabanne is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Lady Million was launched in 2010. Lady Million was created by Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Dominique Ropion and Bruno Jovanovic. Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange flower and Gardenia; base notes are white honey, Patchouli and Amber. 1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.\nFlacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.\n\nThe Notes of Fragrance\nAnne Flipo, Béatrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? “It was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This ‘playful’ aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Amber spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets”.\n Designer of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp.\nWe can expect the fragrance on the market in July 2010. Lady Million makes men's fantasy and desires come true.

Top notes are Lavender, Pineapple, Bergamot and Lemon Verbena; middle notes are Red Apple, Dried Fruits, oak moss, Geranium, Coumarin and Rose; base notes are Tonka Bean and Sandalwood. The brand Mont Blanc presents a new men's fragrance in April 2011. Legend is dedicated to inspiring, virtuous and self-confident men who are courageous, passionate and authentic. Their fragrance is subtle but striking and masculine. Olivier Pescheux, the perfumer behind this fresh fougere creation, tried to make the fragrance filled with contrasts, combining notes that evoke strength and tenderness, tradition and modernity. The composition opens with fresh aromatic tones of bergamot, lavender, pineapple leaf and exotic verbena (Litsea Cubeba). The heart emphasizes oakmoss note (evernyl molecule) merged with geranium, coumarin, apple, rose, and Pomarosa molecule (notes of dried fruit). The base contains sandalwood, tonka and evernyl. Heavy and slightly curved bottle of black and metallic colors is inspired by the famous Meisterstück pen design, made of glass and metal. The design is minimalistic and luxurious, perfect for the concept behind this fragrance. The black and white campaign features Simon Clark photographed by Peter Lindbergh. Legend is available as 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette.
