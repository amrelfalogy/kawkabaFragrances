            With over 15 years of expertise in the world of perfumery, Kawkaba
            Fragrances was born from a passion for crafting exceptional scents.
            Launched online in 2021, we set out to redefine the fragrance
            experience, blending artistry with innovation. In 2025, we proudly
            opened our first store in Arish, marking the beginning of our
            expansion across Egypt to bring our scents closer to perfume lovers
            everywhere. <br />
            <br />
            We believe that choosing a fragrance is a deeply personal journey,
            which is why we have seamlessly integrated technology into the world
            of perfumery, making it easier than ever to find the perfect scent.
            At Kawkaba, we don’t just create perfumes—we craft experiences,
            ensuring every bottle reflects elegance, quality, and a touch of
            individuality.
